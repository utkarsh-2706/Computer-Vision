# Computer Vision Basics with Python ðŸ§ 
This repo contains basic Python scripts I wrote while learning Computer Vision using OpenCV. Each file focuses on a different concept like image processing, edge detection, and contour finding.

# ðŸ“„ Files Overview

1-webcam.py â€“ Capture live video from webcam

2-imageSize.py â€“ Resize image and check its dimensions

3-colorspaces.py â€“ Convert between BGR, HSV, and other color spaces

4-blurring.py â€“ Apply blur effects (Gaussian, Median, etc.)

5-threshold.py â€“ Perform image thresholding

6-edgeDetection.py â€“ Detect edges using Canny algorithm

7-drawing.py â€“ Draw shapes and text using OpenCV

8-contour.py â€“ Find and draw contours in an image

9-colorDetection.py â€“ Detect specific colors in webcam feed

Images like birds.png and whiteboard.png are used for testing purposes.

# ðŸ“Œ Note
These are just practice scripts â€” not a complete project. Made purely for learning purposes.
